## üìÅ Dataset Overview  
- **File Name**: `Retail_Sales.csv`  
- **Key Features**:  
  - `OrderDate`: Order date (datetime).  
  - `Region`: Region of sales (categorical).  
  - `Category`: Product category (categorical).  
  - `Quantity`: Quantity sold (numerical).  
  - `TotalSales`: Total sales revenue (numerical).

## üîß Key Steps in Analysis  

1. **Data Inspection**  
   - Checked data types, summary statistics, memory usage, and null/missing values.  
   - Ensured column names were meaningful and relevant.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Confirmed no missing or duplicate values.  
   - Verified the dataset was ready for analysis.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Numerical Data**:  
     - Descriptive statistics of numerical columns.  
     - Visualized using box plots, KDE plots, and histograms.  
   - **Categorical Data**:  
     - Grouped data to analyze sales and quantity by regions and categories.
